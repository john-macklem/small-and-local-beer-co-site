## About Us

About Us

   We're a small and local brewery from Ottawa. We live local, work local
   and play local. Our brewery started by making one beer. A cold, clean
   lager for everyone to enjoy. We wanted to make a smooth tasting, easy
   drinking beer while still having all the benefits of being a local,
   small company. We then started brewing lots of other small batch
   options at our 411 St Laurent location. IPA's, Sours, Stouts and always
   our Original Local Lager are available at the brewery.
