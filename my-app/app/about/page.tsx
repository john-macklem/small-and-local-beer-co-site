      <p>
        Small and Local Beer Co. began brewing in 2018 with a simple mission: to
        bring fresh, neighborhood-focused beer to Ottawa. We believe in keeping
        things small enough to stay connected with our community while brewing
        flavors everyone can enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022 we rebranded from Original Local Beers to better reflect our
        ethosâ€”supporting local farmers, collaborating with nearby businesses,
        and keeping our environmental footprint light.
